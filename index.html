<h2>Other Actors Who Could Play the Lead Role</h2>
<p>If Prabhas had not played the lead role in <strong>Darling</strong>, here are four actors who could have been great choices. Each of them has a unique style and acting ability that could have brought a different flavor to the character. From Mahesh Babu's charming screen presence to Vijay Deverakonda's youthful energy, these actors could have made the role their own.</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Actor's Name</th>
